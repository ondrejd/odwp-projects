Plugin for managing and publishing projects on your [WordPress](https://www.wordpress.org/) sites. It was created to fit my requirements as a freelancer developer but I tried to make it usable for more people.
It offers new [custom post type](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/register_post_type/) *project* with some meta boxes (repository, system name etc.). It also contains some widgets and shortcodes aimed to the projects hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com).
